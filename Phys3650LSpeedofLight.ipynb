      "       A method we will be using today was developed by Foucault in 1862. The diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 1.  Imagine the rotating mirror MR stationary. Parallel beam of light from the laser is focused at point s by lens L1. Lens L2 is positioned so that the image point at s is reflected from the rotating mirror MR and is focused onto the fixed spherical mirror MF. Mirror MF reflects the light back along the same path to again focus the image at point s.  In order that the reflected point image can be viewed through the microscope, a beam splitter is placed in the optical path, so a reflected image of the returning light is also formed at point s'. Now, suppose that MR is rotated slightly so that the reflected beam strikes MF at a different point. Since the fixed mirror has spherical shape, the beam will still be reflected directly back toward MR. The return image of the source point will still be formed at points s and s'. The only significant difference in rotating MR by a slight amount is that the point of reflection on  MF changes. Now imagine that MR is rotating continuously at a very high speed. In this case, the return image of the source point will no longer be formed at points s and s'.  This is because, with  MR rotating, a light pulse traveling from MR to MF and back finds MR at a different angle when it returns when it was first reflected. Measuring the displacement of the image point caused by rotation of MR, the speed of light can be determined. Detailed analysis shows that the speed of light can be calculated by using the following formula:\n",
